# Software Engineering Concepts in `bingo.py`

## Terms to watch for

- CLI (Command Line Interface)
- Configuration Management
- Docstring Parsing
- File Handling
- Functions (Helper Functions)
- Generators
- Introspection
- Modularity
- Polymorphism (Ad-hoc)
- Recursion

`bingo.py` demonstrates several software engineering principles and Python features that contribute to its design and functionality.

### Python Fundamentals & Style
- **Modularity**: The script is organized into functions, each with a specific purpose, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- **Functions as First-Class Objects**: Python's treatment of functions as first-class objects is utilized, for example, by storing factory functions like `Num` or `Sym` in the `.it` attribute of `o` instances to denote their "type".
- **List Comprehensions and Generators**: These are used for concise data manipulation, e.g., in `inits` or when processing rows. The `csv` function is a generator.
  ```python
  # From csv()
  yield [coerce(s) for s in line.strip().split(',')]
  ```
- **Helper Functions**: Small, focused functions like `coerce`, `cat`, or `norm` encapsulate specific logic, promoting reuse and clarity. This is part of the `Utility Functions` and `Data Input/Parsing` protocols.

### Configuration Management
- **CLI Arguments**: The `cli` function parses command-line arguments to customize the script's behavior. This uses `sys.argv`.
  ```python
  # From cli()
  if arg == "-" + k[0]:
      d[k] = coerce(...)
  ```
- **Docstring Parsing for Defaults**: The global `the` configuration object is initialized by parsing default values from the script's main docstring. This is a clever way to self-document and configure. (`Configuration & CLI` protocol)
  ```python
  # Global 'the' initialization
  the= o(**{m[1]: coerce(m[2])
            for m in re.finditer(r"-\w+\s+(\w+)[^\(]*\(\s*([^)]+)\s*\)", __doc__)}) 
  ```

### Object-Oriented Principles (Lightweight)
- **Struct-like Objects via `o` class**: While not using traditional deep class hierarchies, `bingo.py` uses a simple `o` class to create flexible objects. Factory functions like `Num` and `Sym` return these `o` instances, tagged with an `it` attribute.
- **Ad-hoc Polymorphism**: Functions like `add`, `sub`, `mid`, `div` inspect the `it` attribute of their input object to dispatch to the correct behavior (e.g., numeric vs. symbolic operations). This is seen in the `Initialization & Update` and `Statistical Summaries` protocols.
  ```python
  # From add()
  (_num if i.it is Num else (_sym if i.it is Sym else _data))(i,v)
  ```

### File and Data Handling
- **File I/O**: The `csv` function handles reading data from CSV files. The `webdata` function demonstrates fetching files from a URL and caching them locally. (`Data Input/Parsing` protocol)
- **String Manipulation**: Extensive use of string methods like `strip()`, `split()`, `lower()`, `startswith()`, `isupper()` for parsing data and configurations.
- **Data Type Coercion**: The `coerce` function intelligently converts strings read from files or CLI into appropriate Python types (int, float, bool, str).

### Introspection
- **`globals()`**: Used in `eg_h` and `eg__all` to find and execute example functions (`eg__*`) dynamically. (`Configuration & CLI`, `Example Runners` protocols)

### Recursion
- **`tree` function**: Builds a decision tree recursively. (`Decision Trees` protocol)
- **`nodes` function**: Traverses the tree recursively.
- **`neighbors` function**: Generates neighbor coordinates recursively. (`Clustering & Projection` protocol)

### Error Handling (Minimal)
- `coerce` uses a `try-except` block for type conversion. More extensive error handling is not a primary feature of this script, which is common in research code focused on algorithms.

### Review Questions
1. Explain how `bingo.py` achieves a form of polymorphism without using traditional class inheritance. Provide a code snippet.
2. Describe the mechanism `bingo.py` uses for managing its default configurations and how command-line arguments can override them.
3. What are the benefits of using generator functions like `csv()` in `bingo.py`?
