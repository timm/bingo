# Welcome to tiny AI, big brains.
# 
# <p style="text-align:left;"> 
# bing1.py implements multi-objective optimization, explainable
# decision trees, and active learning — all in under 1000 lines of
# pure Python. It's not just fast, it's smart: blending Bayesian
# reasoning, statistical rigor (bootstrapping, Cliff’s Delta,
# Scott-Knott), and adaptive sampling to get more insight from fewer
# samples.
# 
# <p style="text-align:left;"> 
# Need to explore large config spaces? bing1.py helps you zero in on
# what matters — balancing performance vs. latency, precision vs.
# complexity, or whatever metrics drive your decisions.
# 
# <ul style="text-align:left;"> 
# <li> Don’t just run experiments. Understand them.
# <li> Don’t just crunch numbers. Explain them.
# <li> With bing1.py, you get clear, auditable AI decisions — fast.
# </ul>
